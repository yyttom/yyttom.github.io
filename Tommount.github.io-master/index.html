            <p>Today I watched the Chinese movie <em><strong>A World Without Thieves</strong></em>!</p>
            <p> It tells the story of a thief couple's better nature asserts itself, and they protected a simple boy named Roots and his 60000 yuan from another group of thieves on the train. The two group of thieves fight both with open and secret means. In the end, the boy and the money are safe, but the thieves are all captured by the police and send to the jail.</p>
            <p>From the movie I learned that there are thieves in the world, so we mustn't let everyone around us known that we have many monies because “<em>An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth</em>”.</p>

          <p>Today I watched the movie  <em><strong>Saving Private Ryan</strong></em>！</p>
        <p>This movie shows the sensation of lost in the shadows in a normal soldier’s heart, it also shows the harm to people and countries of the callous and cruel war. </p>
        <p>The movie uses the flashback technique to tell a story of a rescue mission in the Second World War,  private Ryan’s three brothers died in the war, and himself was trapped in the enemy-occupied area, so a group of soldiers was sent to rescue him and send him back home…… </p>
        <p>My favourite character in the movie is Ryan, he has strong will、courage and sense of responsibility, he didn’t leave he’s comrades when the group found him and told him that they would took him home, instead, he asked the group to stay, and they fought together. </p>
        <p>On the way searching for Ron the group members suspected about a mission, but they had a strong leader, when some members wants to quit the mission, it’s the captain’s epic speech which made them stay and encourage them to go on. This is The power of leadership, it can make a fail change to victory. </p>
       <p>It’s really a classical movie, I wish you will enjoying it. </p>

            <p>In the short 54 years, there are four Roman emperors came and gone.</p>
            <p>Are they really that notorious?</p>
            <p>Is the time of heroes has gone far away, or the age of tyrants is coming?</p>
            <p>Are they the pusher of the empire’s perish, or are they a page in the time of a big changing?</p>
            <p>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, the four controversial emperors in the Roman history, their stories are in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅶ Notorious Emperors</strong></em>  which I finished reading today!</p>
            <p>Actually, I think Tiberius and Claudius are not so bad, it’s just Tiberius is too cold to people and Claudius is too cowardly, so people thought they are bad. This also shows that it’s not easy being an emperor.</p>
            <p>I discovered something as well——in history, many emperors who has talent in art don’t have talent in ruling an empire, like Nero who was good at music, and Li Yu in China who was good at writing poems.</p>

    <p>I was furious today， because I planned today’s blog to be a text about the argue between my father and my grandmother, but they both forbid me to post it on my website even I had written it down, it really made me angry. Because it’s the only interesting or important thing happened today, if I can’t post it I can’t think of anything else to write about! So in the end I decided just to write about this thing itself.</p>

      <p>I was playing around on YouTube when I discovered a “360° Video” part I was very curious about it, so I secretly watched one of the videos and found it really wonderful and magical!</p>
      <p>It’s like watching a VR movie! You can see things in all directions by dragging on the screen, and fortunately, I also found out that my father had downloaded some videos on the computer they really glut my eyes!</p>

     <p>It’s a sad history of the empire, enemies watch for the proper moment for war, compatriots battle in a melee.</p>
     <p>The empire is going to perish, many emperors died of murder and war.</p>
     <p>In the series of ordeals, will the empire reborn or will it be ruined and lost it’s glory?</p>
     <p>This piece of history is in the book The Story of the Romans Ⅷ Crisis and Overcome which I finished reading today!</p>
     <p>From the book, I learned that “Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme”.  Vitellius tried to kill all the soldiers who swore their loyalty to the previous emperor——Otho, to prevent them from overthrowing him, but that only made his life shorter. And the emperor Vespasianus who made lows to forbid others overthrown an emperor by prosecuting him to make the emperors after him (his sons) safer, but that led to the assassination of Domitianus, because there is no other ways of getting rid of him.</p>

     <p>Today I read the short story <strong><em>The Two Fishermen</em></strong> written by Maupassant.</p>
     <p>It tells the story of two fishermen friends went fishing when their city is besieged by enemies in a war, they have the password in their army, and they are very careful, but they are still caught by the enemy.</p>
     <p>From the story, I learned that we mustn’t take unnecessary risks, like the two fishermen, but I also see courage and loyalty in their hearts, because they didn’t tell the passwords to the enemy, which made them die in the end.</p>

     <p>the video caused me to rethink deeply about the world around us, because it is proved that our basic senses, our elementary ways to explore the world can mislead us, so are the world just a mislead or a “delicate fiction”? If it is, what is the real world like? If it isn’t, how can we prove it?</P>
     <p>But of course, these questions have no answers, though I will still be glad to hear your thoughts!</P>

    <p>I tested my vocabulary today!</p> 
    <p>I was really excited to see my reading vocabulary reached 6000 and my listening vocabulary reached 7000!</p>
    <p>I was worried before the test, but unfortunately the worry comes true. When I’m testing my listening vocabulary, the phone suddenly stuck in a page and won’t let me go on testing when I’m almost finished! So I have to test again, but "<em>a loss may turn out to be a gain, misfortune may be an actual luck</em>"，maybe I’ve done worse in the unfinished one than the one I finished!  Who knows!</p>

   <p>Today I thought about an interesting question, water is important to us, we can't live without them, but gold is more expensive than water, even we can't eat or drink it!</p>
   <h3><strong><em>But WHY is it❓❓❓</em></strong></h3>
   <p>Is it just because of the gold is rare, or in some conditions water can be more expensive than gold? There are many hypothesis of mine, but I'd like to hear your thoughts!</p>

    <p>Today I read an article about the difference between pieces knowledge and a knowledge system, knowledges is only useful to us when we put them together and we line them up in a system, learning pieces of knowledge is just a waste of time. Like I know a piece of knowledge in physic and I also know a piece of knowledge in biology or in chemistry but they are just tiny pieces, learning these pieces can’t make me become a physicist or a chemist. And like which superstar like what colors, these are also knowledges but learning them is a waste of time, they have no use to me!</p>
    <p>“Knowledge is power”, this sentence is actually not very correct, it should be “Systems of knowledge is power”. Many knowledges on the Internet nowadays have been ripped apart, they are pieces, they can only make you win a quick quiz but they can’t let you pass a real exam.</p>
    <p>So we must choose what things do we learn carefully, because our time is limited, we mustn’t waste them.</p>

    <p>Today we had a homework of writing a summary of your favorite book, so I wrote a summary of The Hobbit which I recently finished reading.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it’s the longest English composition I’ve ever wrote, it has about 540 words! I was excited, my dad sent my composition to many of his friends who is good at English writing and asked them to give some advise. I can’t share my composition on WeChat like my dad, but I can share it on my website with you!</p>

    <p>I’m learning about chemistry and  astronomy these days and today I thought about a question of how can the protons in the nucleus bond together so tightly? It is widely known that protons are positive electrically charged and electrons are negative electrically charged so they attract each other, but how can the two or more same positive charged protons bonded so tightly together in the nucleus? There must be another more powerful force acting between them. But what force can be stronger than electromagnetic force? I and my farther discussed about this but we can’t work that out, and I didn’t find any good answers on the Internet so if you have any idea, please let me know.</p>

    <p>Today I had a table tennis ball competition with my dad, he won in the end even though l also beat him in some rounds. It really made me feel that my techniques in table tennis needs to be improved. Every time when I strike, the ball will fly too far which made me timid and didn’t dare to strike when there is a chance.</p>
    <p>I am also moving too slow, this really made me lost many scores. I think these are my main problems at table tennis. I will fix them as soon as I can and of course, I’ll keep learning and keep practicing table tennis, maybe some time in the future, I will be able to defeat my dad!</p>

     <p>Today my dad told me about the Zhenbao Island incident. I was excited and interested because I like histories, wars and politics between countries all the time.</p>
     <p>We discussed about the incident and searched it on the Internet, we saw different opinions of the incident from the perspective of different countries. China thought the incident was a self-defense counterattack but Russia thought it’s us who cunningly attacked them first, America on the other hand, thought this incident made it gain profit while it just looks on the battle.</p>
     <p>All in all, I think I can learn a lot from the game between countries and especially powerful and big countries. Because between these countries, every step of action is done with lots of schemes in it, and these schemes are really interesting to consider about.</p>

     <p>I watched lots of videos about sending astronauts to Mars these days, it’s an attractive idea to me because of the mysteries and imaginations about Mars. There are many science fiction books about aliens from Mars and their invasion to Earth.</p>
     <p>As I’m a science fiction fan, I really want to find out whether there are or there were life on Mars. But landing, walking or living on Mars is really different from the moon or the Earth, it’s very difficult, many problems need to be solved and solving them is our mission, because we are the younger generation, we are the future of humanity. Maybe the dream of sending humans to Mars can come true with our hard work when we grow up!</p>

     <p>There are so many coincidences these days, I was learning cosmology and astronomy on Khan Academy and found videos on the internet and TV programs about the universe the planets and galaxies, and today I watched another live lecture of a scientist in Beijing university, about the solar system. I was not only enthusiastic about the idea that there are many “solar system”s just like ours in the universe (the idea was told in the lecture), but also curious about life on other planets.</p>
     <p>The universe is expanding just like our enriching  knowledge we can never explore the universe completely just like we can’t learn all the knowledges. But the process of exploring, discovering and learning it self is a kind of enjoyment.</p>

    <p>Today I finished writing the second chapter of my science fiction novel! In fact it took me almost a year to write it because I have very little time doing things I like, such as writing my novel. Writing this novel actually made me become more interested in biology, astronomy and cosmology, because even it’s science fiction, it still needs science behind it. I will keep writing my novel and hopefully somedays later you’ll find on my blog I’ve finished writing it!</p>

     <p>This time we went out early in the evening and played table tennis for an hour, then, when it’s getting dark, we went to the playground to play badminton and met another friend there. So we played basketball for a long time before we  went home happily.</p>

     <p>Today I read an article about the America’s economy development. From the article I found out that countries would do anything: war, tricks, even lies to gain profit. I also saw that it’s not easy being a president or the leader of a country because they have to have good strategy layouts, they have to be wise and most importantly, they also have to be a half scientist, half economist and half strategist.</p>
     <p>Like my father said, “Statesmen are careful with every word they say and their words usually don’t just have one meaning, you should never just comprehend their words literally.” it’s obviously hard to do that all the time but “with great power, comes great responsibility”, if you want the power, you have to undertake the responsibility first.</p>

However, the second video is more exciting than the first one, it tells the story of the five richest and most powerful families in the world, sadly the speech-speed of this video is too fast, I can’t catch up with it very well.

      <p>Today I watched several videos about Sir Francis Drake and his great voyages across the sea. I was learning about Sir Francis Drake in my English class and my parents liked to expand the things I’m learning in class, so they found videos about him and I really benefited a lot from them. In class and in the videos, I was told  that Drake is adventurous and courageous, he have done heroic things, but they are all avoiding the fact that Drake sold slaves and marauded ships from other countries, he was a bad pirate who captures and sells slaves! How can he be a hero? Moreover, Drake was said as an explorer, but his circumnavigate around the globe was just because of the way to get back to England was blocked by the Spanish fleet so he have to go the other way, that is to circumnavigate the globe, that’s not an epic voyage, it’s a fugitive running for his life!</p>

      <p>Today my father finally agreed to let me watch the second movie of The Lord of the Rings series—— The Two Towers! I was dreaming of watching it since I’ve watched the first one because it was so attractive, you just can’t stop watching it! It’s really enjoying to drink milk while watching a good movie, I had a wonderful time watching it! Moreover, we also made some dumplings with the noodle-making machine I mentioned before, it’s more efficient and mechanized now, you can easily make pastries out of the noodle-making machine, then you only have to press the mould on them and add the fillings! How simple!</p>

     <p>Today at lunchtime, I and my father were invited to a banquet, I was very happy because the foods are tasty and I made a friend at the table, we discussed about histories and were both pleased and impressed.</p>
     <p>After the banquet, he invited me to go and climb the Zhao Mu mountain with him, I asked my father about this and he agreed to come with us and I got into their car, soon we arrive at their home, and I can’t see my father’s car following behind, so I asked them about this but they said that my father drove home and haven’t followed their car, then they led me to the home, my friend changed clothes and we played chess for a while.</p>
     <p>Afterwards we got in the car and they drove towards the Zhao Mu mountain, on the way, we were told that there are too many visitors on the mountain, so they changed the plan and brought us to an exercising center and there was a personal coach waiting for us, we run around the playground in circles, and was very tired when we get back again. By the way, my friend’s parents were very rich they live in a big house which is unexpected to me, I was feeling restricted and unhappy and the dinner was distasteful. I was finally back at home after having dinner, it was really an unpleasant afternoon I was very upset, I went back home signing tiredly.</p>

       <p>Today I continued to record my novel on the computer, but I have no idea how to encrypt it ,because I don’t want my parents to read my novel when I haven’t finished writing it yet. However, Just then, my mother phoned me and asked me to compress some files on the computer and send them to her, moreover, she taught me how to compress a file and I noticed an “encryption” button when I’m compressing the files! I was excited and put what I have learned into practice , soon I succeed encrypting my novel!</p>

      <p>Today I visited my grandparents, we haven’t seen each other for three months, because of that my grandparents were excited when they heard I am going to visit them yesterday, we received a warm welcome when we arrived at their home. After lunch, my grandfather took me to take a walk in the park near their house, The park was very beautiful in spring, there were many flowers and green grasses. The park had changed a lot, I haven’t went there for a year and now new lakes and pavilions were built, walking in these beautiful new buildings, I felt a strong poetic inspiration, now I am planning to write a poem about the wonderful scenes in the park and my feelings tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Today I watched a video broadcasted by BBC about “Du Fu, the greatest poet in China history”! I liked to watch videos about China’s history from the point of view of foreigners all the time, this time also but it was more interesting than the other videos because there are the poems of Du Fu translated to English and read in the tone of Shakespeare’s plays! I think the translation is quite good and had a special charm. I have read lots of Chinese poems written by Du Fu, I know his style very well and I can still feel it in the English translation, his worry about the fall of the dynasty, his compassion on the poor and his indignation of the wickedness. All these characteristics are respectable and honorable.</p>

However, my father thought I am speeding up the video to muddle through and watch the movie, he was furious but I explained why, he still suspects me and paused the video many times to check that I was listening and thinking, I answered his questions correctly every time so that he must admit  I’m not trying to muddle him and let me watch the movie.</p>
